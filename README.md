| Project 1 | Design an **E-R diagram** and **relational schema** for a convenience store. Entities may include stores, employees, customers, products, and sales. Define relationships such as “a store sells products” or “an employee manages sales.” |
| Project 2 | Normalize the relational schema (up to **3NF or BCNF**) to remove redundancy. Implement **SQL queries** to retrieve data like “total sales by product,” “inventory per store,” or “employees working at each branch.” |
